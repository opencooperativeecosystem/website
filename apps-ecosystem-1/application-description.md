## Coopshares

One of the greatest problems faced by cooperatives, social enterprises and peer to peer production projects is the lack of access to sufficient funding and investors. CoopShares was ideated In response to this challenge, for building \(out\) the broader based services required in the fast growing social and individual sovereignty based Commons ecosphere now enabled by recent evolution of Commons principles. Besides funding its own growth via crowdfunded equity solutions and offering investors funding options via CoopShares, Coopshares will be a platform of services for CoopShares social equity funding and trading.
